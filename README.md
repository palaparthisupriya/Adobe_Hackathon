Adobe Hackathon – Round 1A & 1B Solution
This repository contains our solutions for Adobe’s "Connecting the Dots" Hackathon 2025.

Round 1A: Extracts the document title and outline structure (H1, H2, H3) from PDFs using font size and pattern-based heading detection.

Round 1B: Matches a given persona and their goal with the most relevant content across multiple PDF documents using offline semantic search (TF-IDF + cosine similarity).

Both modules are fully offline, Dockerized, and optimized for fast, accurate processing of real-world PDF files.
